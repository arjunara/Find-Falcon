# Find-Falcon
It is a Geektrust UI coding challenge to practice React js


#King Shan has received intelligence that Al Falcone is in hiding in one of these 6 planets - DonLon, Enchai, Jebing, 
Sapir, Lerbin & Pingasor. However he has limited resources at his disposal & can send his army to only 4 of these 
planets. 
#This coding problem is to help King Shan find Al Falcone.
#I have build a UI through which King Shan can 
• select 4 planets to search (out of the total 6) 
• select which space vehicles to send to these planets 
• see how much time it will take for the vehicles to reach their targets & 
• show final result of success or failure
